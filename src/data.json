      "info": "Most recently, I was part of an Agile cross-functional team at Infor tasked with migrating the codebase for an existing enterprise application from Windows Form to ASP.Net MVC. We leveraged Web Services and XML while working with our Australian counterparts to deliver the desired solution. We used JavaScript and jQuery for front-end and, aside from development, I was assigned to build and deploy our server for my QA team for their testing processes. Also, I mentored one of my new team members. I have experence working with small teams to develop trading platforms using C#, WPF and SQL for foreign exchange companies."

However, I also believe that working collaboratively with a team is crucial to delivery of the product. So, if there is a particularly difficult problem, I collaborate with my colleagues and use it as a learning experience to improve my skills."
